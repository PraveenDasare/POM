case 1: There shoudl be atleast two ranges in order to compare else comparision no comparision 
case 2: ranges will not overlap if end_1<start_1
case 3: the ranges will not overlap if end_2<start_2
case 4: the ranges will overlap if !((end_1<start_2 OR end_2<start_1))
case 5: the ranges will overlap if(end_1>=start_2 AND end_2>=start_1)
csee 6: the ranges will overlap if end_1<start_2 OR end_2<start_1 

case 1: critical
case 2 and 3 and 4 are important
case 5 and 6 are good to have
